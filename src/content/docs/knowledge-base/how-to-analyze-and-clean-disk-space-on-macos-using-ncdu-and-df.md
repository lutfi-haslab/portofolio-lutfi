# üßπ How to Analyze and Clean Disk Space on macOS Using `ncdu` and `df`

Keeping your macOS system clean and your disk space under control is essential ‚Äî especially when you're building large projects like Xcode apps or using environments like Node.js. In this post, you'll learn how to inspect, analyze, and free up space using `ncdu` and `df`.

## üì¶ Step 1: Install `ncdu` (Disk Usage Analyzer)

`ncdu` (NCurses Disk Usage) is a fast, interactive command-line tool for analyzing disk usage. First, install it via Homebrew:

```bash
brew install ncdu
````

## üîç Step 2: Scan Your Home Directory

Use `ncdu` to recursively analyze your home directory:

```bash
ncdu ~
```

This will launch an interactive UI where you can:

* Browse hidden files and folders
* Sort by size
* Delete files interactively (press `d`)
* Navigate folders (`Enter`, `q` to quit)

## üíΩ Step 3: Check Overall Disk Space with `df`

Use the built-in `df` command to check how much disk space is left:

```bash
df -h ~
```

**Sample Output:**

```
Filesystem      Size   Used  Avail Capacity  Mounted on
/dev/disk3s1s1  500G   390G   110G    78%    /
```

This tells you:

* Total size of your disk
* How much is used
* How much is available

## üßπ Step 4: Clean Common Large Directories

### 1. `DerivedData` (Xcode)

Used for build cache ‚Äî safe to delete:

```bash
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/*
```

### 2. `Archives` (Xcode)

Stores archived `.xcarchive` files. Delete only if you no longer need them for distribution or symbolication:

```bash
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Archives/*
```

### 3. `Trash`

```bash
rm -rf ~/.Trash/*
```

### 4. `.npm`, `.cache`, etc.

```bash
rm -rf ~/.npm/*
rm -rf ~/.cache/*
```

### 5. Find and Remove All `node_modules`

If you have multiple JavaScript projects (e.g., under `hasdev/*`), you can remove all `node_modules` like this:

```bash
find hasdev -type d -name node_modules -exec rm -rf {} +
```

## üß† Pro Tip: Combined Overview

Want a quick view of both disk usage and available space?

```bash
df -h ~
ncdu ~
```

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Tool   | Purpose                          | Usage Example               |
| ------ | -------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `ncdu` | Analyze disk usage interactively | `ncdu ~`                    |
| `df`   | View total and free disk space   | `df -h ~`                   |
| `find` | Search and clean large dirs      | `find . -name node_modules` |

Using `ncdu` + `df` gives you a powerful combo for managing disk usage without any bloated GUI tools. Clean regularly, and automate the tedious bits to keep your macOS development environment lean and fast.
