In this article, we’ll explore why good commit messages matter and how you can follow best practices, including the popular **conventional commit style** (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`).

## Why Good Commit Messages Matter

A well-written commit message:

- Explains **why** something was changed
- Helps your team understand the **context** behind changes
- Makes it easier to **debug**, **review**, or **revert** code
- Improves collaboration and **code maintainability**
- Can be used to auto-generate **changelogs**

Think of each commit as a **log entry** in the history of your project — not just for others, but also for your future self!

## The Anatomy of a Good Commit Message

A good commit message should be **concise**, **descriptive**, and follow a consistent format.

### ✅ Basic Format

```
<type>: <subject>

<body> (optional)
```

### 🔧 Type (required)

The type describes what kind of change this is. These are typically short codes that help categorize the nature of the commit.

Here are some commonly used types:

| Type     | Description                        |
|----------|------------------------------------|
| `feat`   | A new feature                      |
| `fix`    | A bug fix                          |
| `docs`   | Documentation only changes         |
| `style`  | Code style changes (no logic)      |
| `refactor` | Code refactoring (no features/bugs) |
| `perf`   | Performance improvements           |
| `test`   | Adding tests or fixing them        |
| `chore`  | Maintenance tasks (e.g., build, deps) |
| `ci`     | CI/CD configuration changes        |
| `build`  | Build system or external dependency changes |
| `revert` | Reverts a previous commit          |

### 📝 Subject (required)

A brief summary (50 characters or less) of the change.

### 💬 Body (optional)

If needed, explain **what** and **why** you did something. Avoid the "how" — the code shows that.

## ✨ Examples of Good Commit Messages

```bash
feat: add user profile page
```

```bash
fix: prevent null pointer exception in login flow
```

```bash
docs: update contributing guide with setup instructions
```

```bash
refactor: extract validation logic into separate module
```

```bash
perf: optimize image loading speed by lazy-loading thumbnails
```

```bash
test: add unit tests for cart calculation logic
```

```bash
chore: upgrade dependencies in package.json
```

```bash
revert: revert accidental deletion of core library
```

## 🛠 Tips for Better Commits

1. **Use the imperative mood**: Like “Fix bug” instead of “Fixed bug” or “Fixes bug”.  
   Example: `feat: add password strength meter` ✅ vs `feat: added password strength meter` ❌

2. **Keep it concise**: Aim for clarity over verbosity.

3. **Link to issues or PRs**: If applicable, reference an issue or pull request.
   ```bash
   feat(auth): implement email verification #1234
   ```

4. **Group related changes**: Each commit should do one thing. Avoid large commits with unrelated changes.

5. **Review before committing**: Double-check your changes (`git diff`) and ensure your message reflects them accurately.

6. **Amend when necessary**: Don’t be afraid to edit your last commit:
   ```bash
   git commit --amend
   ```

## 🧰 Tools That Help

- **Commitizen** – Interactive CLI to guide you through creating conventional commits.
- **Husky + Commitlint** – Enforce commit conventions via linting rules.
- **VSCode Extensions** – Many extensions help format and validate commit messages.

## 🎯 Summary

Writing good Git commit messages is a small investment that pays off over time. By adopting a standard like **Conventional Commits**, you’ll make your repository more readable, searchable, and maintainable.

Start today with:

```bash
git commit -m "feat(blog): introduce conventional commit style"
```
